# About me.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Hey there! I’m Ariel, a sysadmin and backend developer with a knack for diving deep into the tech trenches. On this site, you’ll find Docker Compose scripts, Python apps, and guides for setting up and configuring LAMP servers, networking setups, and more—all built from scratch, no shortcuts. I also share solutions to those oddly specific Linux tasks that tend to go unnoticed by casual users. Feel free to borrow anything you find interesting here; I’m all about sharing ideas and brainstorming those who want to go beyond surface-level configurations and take control of their systems. Welcome to my little corner on the web.
